# systems-troubleshooting-lab
Virtual IT lab focused on networking, identity, and service failures. Documents intentional misconfigurations, diagnostic reasoning, root cause analysis, and fixes to demonstrate structured troubleshooting skills.

## The goal 
To analyze how a centralized identity authority, dependent services, and client access form a trust and decision chain in a small enterprise-style environment, and how failures in that chain manifest when configuration or assumptions are wrong.



## Scope
- Focus on a small enterprise-style system where user identity is centralized and services rely on that identity to make decisions.
- Study how client access to services depends on a chain of trust involving identity, service configuration, and network reachability.
- Emphasize failures caused by misconfiguration, incorrect assumptions, or broken trust relationships, and the process of diagnosing them.

## Non-Goals
- Redundancy, large-scale enterprise infrastructure.
- Performance optimization or benchmarking.
- Attack simulation or cybersecurity related topics.
